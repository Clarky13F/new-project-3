      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Welcome to our MERN Stack Single-Page Application!</p>
      <p>
        This project was created with the goal of demonstrating our skills in building a full-stack web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team has worked hard to create a user-focused application that solves a real-world challenge. We've used technologies like GraphQL, MongoDB, JWT authentication, and more to ensure a scalable and secure application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to explore our application, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
